A ReactJS wrapper for Google reCAPTCHA

## Getting Started

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) in our project, that also means that we bundle the type definitions with the package distribution.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), although previous versions can still work;
- We recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) as package manager, but you can opt for NPM too.


### Installing

Just run the following snippet and you're ready to go:

```
yarn add @bitcointrade/react-recaptcha
